## List Invoices

Returns a list of invoices for a given location. The response 
is paginated. If truncated, the response includes a `cursor` that you    
use in a subsequent request to fetch the next set of invoices.
For more information about retrieving invoices, see [Retrieve invoices](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/docs/invoices-api/overview#retrieve-invoices).

```ruby
def list_invoices(location_id:,
                  cursor: nil,
                  limit: nil)
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Tags | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `location_id` | `String` | Query, Required | The ID of the location for which to list invoices. |
| `cursor` | `String` | Query, Optional | A pagination cursor returned by a previous call to this endpoint. <br>Provide this cursor to retrieve the next set of results for your original query.<br><br>For more information, see [Pagination](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/docs/working-with-apis/pagination). |
| `limit` | `Integer` | Query, Optional | The maximum number of invoices to return (200 is the maximum `limit`). <br>If not provided, the server <br>uses a default limit of 100 invoices. |

### Response Type

[`List Invoices Response Hash`](/doc/models/list-invoices-response.md)

### Example Usage

```ruby
location_id = 'location_id4'
cursor = 'cursor6'
limit = 172

result = invoices_api.list_invoices(location_id: location_id, cursor: cursor, limit: limit)

if result.success?
  puts result.data
elsif result.error?
  warn result.errors
end
```

## Create Invoice

Creates a draft [invoice](#type-invoice) 
for an order created using the Orders API.

A draft invoice remains in your account and no action is taken. 
You must publish the invoice before Square can process it (send it to the customer's email address or charge the customerâ€™s card on file). 
For more information, see [Manage Invoices Using the Invoices API](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/docs/invoices-api/overview).

```ruby
def create_invoice(body:)
```

retrieve invoices. In the current implementation, you can only specify one location and 
optionally one customer.

that you use in a subsequent request to fetch the next set of invoices. 
For more information about retrieving invoices, see [Retrieve invoices](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/docs/invoices-api/overview#retrieve-invoices).

## Publish Invoice

Publishes the specified draft invoice. 

After an invoice is published, Square 
follows up based on the invoice configuration. For example, Square 
sends the invoice to the customer's email address, charges the customer's card on file, or does 
nothing. Square also makes the invoice available on a Square-hosted invoice page. 

The invoice `status` also changes from `DRAFT` to a status 
based on the invoice configuration. For example, the status changes to `UNPAID` if 
Square emails the invoice or `PARTIALLY_PAID` if Square charge a card on file for a portion of the 
invoice amount).
